Episode mistakes: 
-JT Barret did not try to switch seats with Cardale Jones. I was confused because he tried to avoid the checkpoint (but was caught), not avoid by switching drivers. Also he is 20 so he was underaged and more than 4 times the .02 legal limit for that age.

                Kyle and I have a civilized discourse about the sporting world in which we live. We try to keep it humorous and enjoyable while still talking about sports. We hit on some things ESPN won&apos;t talk about including soccer and hockey! Yes soccer and hockey! Have a listen and let us know what you think at teamcajonespodcast@gmail.com. Episode mistakes: Sean Paul is Jamaican

Episode mistakes: 
-JT Barret did not try to switch seats with Cardale Jones. I was confused because he tried to avoid the checkpoint (but was caught), not avoid by switching drivers. Also he is 20 so he was underaged and more than 4 times the .02 legal limit for that age.

                What are Kyle and I being for Halloween?! What 2 time Cy young winner emailed us this week and why?! Find out all that and more in this week&apos;s episode of The Scout Team Podcast.

If I&apos;m being honest this week wasn&apos;t our best episode and we went 15 minutes over, but we already discussed how to be better next week and if you have any ideas or topics you want discussed please tell us at thescoutteampodcast@gmail.com
                
Episode mistakes: 
-We went long 
-Meant to say Miami is a great program instead of listing Florida twice
-Jack Eichel is a forward (hence the minutes played being impressive)

                Kyle and I have a civilized discourse about the sporting world in which we live. We try to keep it humorous and enjoyable while still talking about sports. We hit on some things ESPN won&apos;t talk about including soccer and hockey! Yes soccer and hockey! Have a listen and let us know what you think at teamcajonespodcast@gmail.com.

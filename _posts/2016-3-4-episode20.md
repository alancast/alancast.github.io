<p>In our final ever episode Kyle and Alex go out in high spirits and discuss the endless sports debates, listener mail, hockey, rapid fire questions, lessons learned, reminisce, make you smile, and much much more! Check it out! We sincerely really have enjoyed making this podcast for our listeners and will miss doing it, but we wanted to retire on top. Thank you to everyone who helped; the podcast dies but the friendships never will, so keep in touch.</p>

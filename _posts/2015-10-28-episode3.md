<p>What are Kyle and I being for Halloween?! What 2 time Cy young winner emailed us this week and why?! Find out all that and more in this week's episode of The Scout Team Podcast. </p>
<p>If I'm being honest this week wasn't our best episode and we went 15 minutes over, but we already discussed how to be better next week and if you have any ideas or topics you want discussed please tell us at thescoutteampodcast@gmail.com</p>
<p>Episode mistakes: 
<br>-We went long 
<br>-Meant to say Miami is a great program instead of listing Florida twice
<br>-Jack Eichel is a forward (hence the minutes played being impressive)</p>
